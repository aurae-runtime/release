# Release

This repository will maintain the releases for the aurae project.

## Project Status

The project is very young and under active development. The APIs are subject to change without notice until further notice.
As we continue to develop the project the APIs will stabilize and eventually a long term stable release will be offered.

At this time the project should not be run in production.

Please read [getting involved](https://aurae.io/community/#getting-involved) if you are interested in joining the project in its early phases. Contribution types of all types and ranges are welcome.

## Release Artifacts

> Note: some of these links may not function until we release the first build

The following artifacts will be available with every stable build. While we are in alpha, only artifacts that share the same version are known to be compatible.
